                  of real users interacting with an interface. we created personas and storyboards to uncover just what makes good design, good design. </p>

                  <p>have you ever looked at a website and thought to yourself, this would be so much better if... in responsive redesign the goal
                    was to choose an existing webiste and give it a makeover. using the design process we evaluted the existing site in terms of 
                    usability and accessibility, prototyped a new solution, and implemented a fully responsive website.

                  <h3>iterative design</h3>
                  <p>design solutions for business. in iterative design we designed an interactive interface for an emerging startup.
                    the goal was to exemplify an iterative desing process flow. we created sketches, hi-fidelity prototypes, conducted user
                  testing on a final revised prototype, and even sent the finished product to the startup itself!   </p>

                  <h3>development</h3>
                  <p>react for list-based interface. in development, the goal was to develop an interactive interface, use interface
                    components, and tie the components to an internal data state. essentially, an interface for users to select, filter, and aggregate items
                    out of a list.
